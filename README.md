Hello User!
This project was the final group project my team and I did in our Collabrative Application Development Class.
We honed our skills in the agile enviornment, and worked on our presentation to mock clients during our final class meeting.
It was a very fun and interesting learning experience, and I can't wait to do more in the future.
